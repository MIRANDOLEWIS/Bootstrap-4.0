			<h3>NEET PG Admissions: Supreme Court, On Centre's Plea, Advances Case Date</h3>
            <hr style="width:100%; border-bottom:2px solid;">

            <p> The Supreme Court, upon Centre's urgent request, has advanced the date in the hearing of a case raising questions about the ₹ 8 lakh income criteria for identifying Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota in connection with the NEET-PG admissions.</p>
            <hr style="width:80%; border-bottom:2px solid;">
            

            <p class="">A three-judge bench will hear the case on Wednesday after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested before the Chief Justice of India that "doctors are very concerned".The Chief Justice then constituted a special three-judge bench which will have Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant and AS Bopanna as its members.Counselling, which was to begin in October 2021, has been put on hold after a batch of petitions were filed in the Supreme Court challenging a July 29 notification of the Centre announcing a 27 per cent quota to OBCs and 10 per cent reservation to EWS in NEET-PG (All India Quota).Large-scale protests have been held by resident doctors of various hospitals under the banner of the Federation of Resident Doctors' Association (FORDA) in Delhi and other parts of the country over a delay in the NEET-PG counselling, which has been postponed due to the Centre deciding to revisit the criteria for the determination of the EWS quota.</p>

            <h3 >Despite Huge Omicron Surge, Data Signals End Of Pandemic: Scientists</h3>
            <hr style="width:100%; border-bottom:2px solid;">

            <p>A string of new studies has confirmed the silver lining of the omicron variant: Even as case numbers soar to records, the numbers of severe cases and hospitalizations have not. The data, some scientists say, signal a new, less worrying chapter of the pandemic.</p>
            <hr style="width:80%; border-bottom:2px solid;">

            <p>The omicron variant was discovered in South Africa just over a month ago, and experts caution that there is still plenty of time for the situation to change. But data from the past week suggest that a combination of widespread immunity and numerous mutations have resulted in a virus that causes far less severe disease than previous iterations.One study out of South Africa found that patients admitted to the hospital there during the omicron-dominated fourth wave of the virus were 73% less likely to have severe disease than patients admitted during the delta-dominated third wave. "The data is quite solid now that hospitalizations and cases are decoupled," said Wendy Burgers, an immunologist at the University of Cape Town.</p>

            <p>Early on, much of the alarm over omicron was due to the variant's large number of mutations, many of which are on the spike protein, the part of the virus responsible for helping it invade host cells. Those mutations, early data suggested, allowed the virus to easily infect not only unvaccinated people, but also to evade antibody responses from both previous infections and vaccines. But the question remained how omicron would fare once it made its way past those first lines of defense.</p>

            <h3>CSK win IPL 2021: No. 4 in the trophy</h3>
            <hr style="width:100%; border-bottom:2px solid;">

            <p>CSK beat Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL 2021 final by 27 runs to lift their fourth IPL title under MS Dhoni. The former South African captain top-scored in the summit clash with 86 off 59 balls to script Chennai's third successive win over KKR, and undoubtedly the most important one, this season.</p>
            <hr style="width:80%; border-bottom:2px solid;">

            <p>The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is the franchise cricket team based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, which has been playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) since the first edition of the tournament in 2008. They were one of the eight teams to compete in the 2021 Indian Premier League. The Super Kings have previously lifted the IPL title thrice (in 2010, 2011 and 2018). In the final, they beat Kolkata Knight Riders to win their fourth IPL title.</p>

            <p>MS Dhoni says "Before I start talking about CSK, need to talk about KKR. Difficult to come back and do what they have, if any team deserved to win the IPL, it's KKR. Huge credit to the coaches, team and support staff. The break really helped them. Coming to CSK, we shuffled players. We had match winners coming game after game and doing really well. Every final is special, if you look at stats, we may say we're the most consistent team to lose the final too. I feel it's important to come back strong, especially in the knockouts. Frankly no chats, we don't talk a lot [meetings]. It's more one-on-one, our practice sessions are meeting sessions. The moment you get into a team room, it brings about different pressure. Our practice sessions have been good. I would love to thank the fans, wherever we've played, even when we were in South Africa, we've always had a good number of CSK fans. That is what you crave for. Thanks to all of them, it feels like we're playing in Chennai. Hopefully we'll be back in Chennai for the fans. Again I've said it before, it depends on BCCI. With two new teams coming in......we have to decide what is good for CSK. It's not about me being there in top-three or four. It's about making a strong core to ensure the franchise doesn't suffer. The core group, we have to have a hard look to see who can contribute for the next 10 years."</p>
